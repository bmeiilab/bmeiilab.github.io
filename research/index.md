Biomedical Electrical Innovation & Integration Lab (BMEII Lab) focuses on developing wearable bio-impedance systems and multi-signal analysis for chronic disease monitoring. We also advance Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and AI-powered imaging to support precision respiratory care and clinical decision-making. By integrating wearable sensing, artificial intelligence, physiological signal processing, and clinical applications, our mission is to drive innovations in smart healthcare and improve patient outcomes and quality of life.
